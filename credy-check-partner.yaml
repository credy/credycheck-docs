  title: CredyCheck Partner API Documentation
  description: |

    This document describes methods that you must implement as CredyCheck partner.

    All requests that come to your api expect a callback back to credycheck (within 5 seconds).

    To see callback definitions, please check "Callbacks" tab inside the API method spec.

    The implementing partner must give us base url where their api will reside.

    # Glossary
     * Requester - a partner who sends any kind of data query to us
     * Responder - a partner from whom we query any kind of data
     * Envelope - encrypted container for personal ID
     * Us - CredyCheck API
